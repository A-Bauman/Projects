Data science and Python

This repo highlights a bit of my data science work.  The Seattle bicycle project has some interesting analysis and use of Python,
as well as time series.  

The EDA folder is an analysis of the Boston Marathon, mostly exploratory data analysis, though there is some good (difficult to
figure out) visualization.

Otherwise, there are some quick models on various data sets: housing prices, credit card defaults, things like that.  The focus was
purely on modeling, no visualization, mostly to compare modeling types.
